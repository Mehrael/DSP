# Digital Signal Processing

#### The purpose of Creating this Project is to:
Build your framework for Signal processing. [USING PYTHON]  
that have the following features:  
- The ability to read samples of a signal from a txt file and display it in both continuous and discrete representations.  
- The ability to generate sinusoidal or cosinusoidal signals, the user should choose whether he wants cosine or sine, the amplitude A, the phase shift theta, the analog frequency, and the sampling frequency needed.       
- framework includes a menu named Signal Generation with two items sine wave and cosine wave. 
----
framework includes a menu with Arithmetic Operations that includes the following items:  
- Addition: add input signals (any number) and display the resulting signal. 
- Subtraction: subtract input signals and display the resulting signal. 
- Multiplication: multiply a signal by a constant value to amplify or reduce the signal amplitude. (If constant equals -1, then signal will be inverted) 
- Squaring: squaring a signal and displaying the resulting signal. 
- Shifting: add to the signal a (+ve) or (-ve) constant. 
- Normalization: normalize the signal from -1 to 1 or 0 to 1 depending on user choice. 
- Accumulation of input signal

- The ability to quantize an input signal (its samples), the application should ask
the user for the needed levels or number of bits available (in case of number of
bits the application should compute from it the appropriate number of levels).
Thereafter, the application should display the quantized signal and quantization
error besides the encoded signal.
